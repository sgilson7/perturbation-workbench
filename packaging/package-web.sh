# --- cache busting -----------------------------------------------------------
# GitHub Pages serves everything with `Cache-Control: max-age=600`, so for ten
# minutes after a deploy a reload keeps using the previous app.js and .wasm from
# disk cache. That reads as "the fix did not deploy", and worse, a browser can
# mix a fresh script with a stale module. Stamping the content hash into every
# internal asset URL means a changed build is simply a different URL, so a
# stale copy can never be served for it.
